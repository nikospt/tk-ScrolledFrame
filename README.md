# tk-ScrolledFrame
A scrolled frame for Tkinter on python. <br>
tk-ScrolledFrame is a python class that supports vertical scrolling. The class acts similary to a tk Frame. Widgets can be added to the ScrolledFrame content frame with either grid or pack.

## Usage
Simply import tk-ScrolledFrame.py into your python script or copy the ScrolledFrame class into your script.
### Importing a Class from a File with Import
At the top of your script type
```
from tk-ScrolledFrame import ScrolledFrame

```

```
